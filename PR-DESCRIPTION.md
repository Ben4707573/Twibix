# Reorganize Scramble Visualizers

## Changes

- Created a dedicated `/components/scramblers/` directory for scramble visualization components
- Implemented specialized visualizers for cubes (2x2-7x7) and Pyraminx
- Created a unified selector component that chooses the appropriate visualizer based on cube type
- Added appropriate scaling for different cube sizes
- Improved error handling for unsupported cube types
- Archived old visualizer implementations for reference

## Benefits

- Better organization of code
- More maintainable structure for adding new puzzle types
- Dedicated Pyraminx visualizer with triangle-based display
- Responsive sizing that scales with cube complexity
- Clearer error messages for unsupported puzzle types

## Testing

- Verified rendering of 2x2 through 7x7 cubes
- Verified rendering of Pyraminx
- Confirmed that unsupported puzzle types show an appropriate message
- No console errors or warnings

## Future Work

- Add visualizers for other puzzle types (e.g., Clock, Megaminx)
- Improve Pyraminx visualization with better 3D representation
- Add animations for scramble application
